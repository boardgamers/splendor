Guidance for AI agents and contributors working in this repository.

## What this is

Unofficial open-source implementation of the board game Splendor for boardgamers.space (BGS).
Two packages: `packages/engine` (`splendor-engine`, rules + BGS wrapper) and `packages/viewer`
(`splendor-viewer`, Svelte 5 browser UI). See README.md for the full picture.

## Conventions

- **ESM everywhere**: `"type": "module"` in every package. TS imports use explicit `.js`
  extensions in the engine (`moduleResolution: nodenext`) and no extension in the viewer
  (`moduleResolution: bundler`) — follow the local pattern of each package.
- **Node >= 24** (`engines` field, `.nvmrc`), **pnpm 11** workspaces (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`).
- **TypeScript strict**, including `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`. Code must pass `pnpm tsc`
  (engine `tsc --noEmit`, viewer `svelte-check`) with zero errors.
- **No comments by default** — write self-explanatory code; comment only the non-obvious "why"
  (e.g. a BGS contract quirk, a rules edge case). No emojis in code or docs.
- **Formatting**: oxfmt (`.oxfmtrc.json`) — **tabs** for indentation (tabWidth 2),
  120-column lines, Svelte formatting enabled. Run `pnpm fmt` to format, `pnpm fmt:check`
  in CI. Linting: oxlint (`.oxlintrc.json`) with `curly: all` — always brace `if`/`for`/
  `while` bodies. Run `pnpm lint`.
- **Tests**: colocated `*.spec.ts` next to engine sources, run with `node --test` against
  compiled output (`pnpm --filter splendor-engine test` compiles to `dist-test/` first).
  Use `node:assert/strict`.
- **Dependencies**: pin exact versions; verify a version exists (`npm view <pkg> version`)
  before adding it. Keep the dependency list minimal.

## Engine specifics

- **In-place state mutation is intentional.** `applyMove` / `dropPlayer` mutate the passed
  `GameState` and return it, matching BGS/take6 engine semantics (the game-server JSON-serializes
  the state between calls). Illegal moves must throw **before any mutation** — validation runs
  first (`validate()` in `src/moves.ts`). Never mutate-then-throw.
- The game state must stay JSON-serializable at all times (no functions, no class instances,
  no Map/Set) because BGS round-trips it through `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(...))`.
- All randomness goes through the seeded PRNG (`src/prng.ts`); the seed arrives via `init`.
  Never use `Math.random` in the engine — replay determinism depends on it.
- `packages/engine/wrapper.ts` is the BGS Engine API contract: keep the exported names and
  signatures in sync with the platform's `app/types/engine.ts`. `dist/wrapper.js` must exist
  after build (it is the registered `entryPoint`).
- Card/noble data (`src/data.ts`) reproduces the published base-game list; treat it as
  rules data, not creative content.

## Viewer specifics

- **Svelte 5 runes mode only**: `$state`, `$derived`, `$props`, `$effect`. No legacy
  `export let`, no `$:` reactive statements.
- The viewer must keep working both inside the BGS iframe (postMessage bridge in
  `src/lib/bgs.ts`) and standalone (dev harness: `packages/viewer/index.html` + `src/dev.ts`).
  Uplink events are emitted on the emitter returned by `launch()` as well as posted to
  `window.parent`, so a local backend can subscribe the same way BGS does.
- Keep everything asset-free: cards and chips are pure CSS. Theme tokens live in
  `src/lib/theme.css`.
- The BGS host measures `body.scrollHeight` — normal top-down document flow, no vertical
  centering tricks.

## Workflow

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev      # viewer dev server + mock backend harness
pnpm fmt      # oxfmt format (tabs, 120 cols)
pnpm lint     # oxlint (curly rule)
pnpm tsc      # engine tsc + viewer svelte-check
pnpm test     # engine tests
pnpm build    # engine dist/ + viewer dist/ (iife + css)
pnpm check    # fmt:check + lint + tsc + test + build
```

Run `pnpm check` before committing. Commit with clear messages; do not create PRs
(this repo has no remote).
